	    <p id="img__description__4">This was my capstone project at NUS which was done in a team of six people, a prelude to my final year project. The project's objective was to design a wearable to detect dance moves. IMUs were attached to the wrist to capture hand movements. At periodic intervals, an arduino polls the IMUs for data. This data is then pushed to a raspberry pi, which uses the data to determine the dance move via machine learning. I was responsible for the hardware aspect of the wearable. </p>
